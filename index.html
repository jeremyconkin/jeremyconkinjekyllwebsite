My approach blends technical expertise, strategic vision, and a commitment to fostering high-performing, collaborative cultures.</p>

A user-centered approach has consistently delivered measurable outcomes, such as improving app ratings from below 2.5 stars to above 4.5/5 stars for many applications, decreasing application down-time without increasing cloud costs, and empowering organizations to release technology updates several times a day.</p>
            <p>Technology is most effective for businesses when it accelerates the core business function. As a consultant, I strive to align technical solutions with business goals. My technical expertise includes software development in many programming languages; cloud architectures using AWS technologies like CDK and SAM; and advanced development for AR/VR experiences. I have certifications as an AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate, AWS Certified Developer – Associate, Contentful Certified Professional, and Certified ScrumMaster.</p>
